			<b>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</b>

			Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like
			web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that
			enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor
			the traffic patterns of users form one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you
			have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve side performance, and to measure the
			success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining
			cookies will impair their functioning.

			<br />
			<br />
			<b>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</b>

			Websites may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as Local Shared Objects or “LSOs”) to, among other things, collect and store
			information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations. If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on
			your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Webpage
			Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions
			(which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to “information” on the
			Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and
			later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that
			setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
			applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.

			<br />
			<br />
			<b>Do you serve targeted advertising?</b>

			Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use
			information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may
			be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by
			them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant
			advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or
			them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.

			<br />
			<br />
			<b>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</b>

			We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other
			operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of
			cookies and related technologies. The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
